# 🖐️ ASL Calculator using PyTorch 🔢  

This project is a **real-time sign language calculator** that recognizes **American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures** and performs arithmetic operations accordingly. It is built using **PyTorch** and **OpenCV** to detect ASL digits and mathematical operators from hand gestures.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ Recognizes **ASL signs** for digits (0-9) and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)  
🧠 Uses **CNN-based deep learning model** for gesture classification  
📷 Implements **OpenCV for real-time video processing**  
🖥️ Displays recognized expressions and computed results dynamically  
♿ Enhances **accessibility** for non-verbal communication in mathematical contexts  

## 🔧 Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ASP1272/ASL-Calculator.git
   cd ASL-Calculator
